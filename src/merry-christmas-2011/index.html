          <h2>The Visher Testimony</h2>
          <quote>We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks, for your name is near. We recount your wondrous deeds! — <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/search/psalms+75/">Psalms 75.1</a></quote>
          <p>So much has happened in 2011 and we are excited to share it with you all. Be sure to click on all the pictures. There's plenty more where they came from over on <a href="http://flickr.com/stopsineman">Flickr</a>!</p>
          <h3 class="narrative-break">January</h3>
          <!-- Found out we were pregnant -->
          <!-- Started going through Revelation -->

          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6560994469/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/honor-eating.jpg" class="right" alt="Pic of Honor eating 02-08-2011" width="200" height="133" /></a>
          <p>The year starts out with the best news ever: another baby! The baby would be due sometime in the middle of August and Jess would soon experience morning sickness with two toddlers. She'd be lying if she said it wasn't very difficult!</p>
          <p>This month we started going through <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Revelation/">The Revelation to John</a> as a family, trying to do a “family worship” after meals, which has been <strike>impossible</strike> tricky to maintain.</p>

          <h3 class="narrative-break">February</h3>
          <!-- Noah born -->

          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6560995769/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/tim-holding-noah.jpg" alt="Pic of Tim holding baby Noah 02-23-2011" class="left" width="133px" height="200px" /></a>
          <p>One very exciting thing happened this month: Tim's sister, Katie, gave birth to a little boy, Noah Rowan Harper, on February 23, and the Harper Clan grew by 1! He introduced us to the world of being an aunt and an uncle and Jesse and Katie to world of parenthood. We look forward to the blessings of a cousin for our children and a nephew for ourselves.</p>


          <h3 class="narrative-break">March</h3>
          <!-- Honor turns one- trip to Elmwood with Sam -->
          <!-- Started Hobbit -->
          <!-- Kristen's third birthday -->

          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6560997895/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/tim-fiery-zoo.jpg" alt="Pic of Fiery and Tim at zoo 03-12-2011" width="200px" height="133px" class="right" /></a>
          <p>Honor turned one in March and, just like with Fiery, we took the family to the <a href="http://www.elmwoodparkzoo.org/">Elmwood Park Zoo</a> to celebrate with Aunt Sammie.</p>
          <p>We started a <strike>sporadic</strike> weekly reading time with the family and we started with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit">The Hobbit</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien">J.R.R. Tolkien</a>. The kids were still too young to really “get into” this one but we enjoyed reading it out loud.</p>
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6560999621/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/kristen.jpg" alt="Pic of Kristen 03-19-2011" width="200px" height="133px" class="left"></a>
          <p>We took a trip to Branchburg, NJ for our cousin Kristen's third birthday.</p>


          <h3 class="narrative-break">April</h3>
          <!-- Trip to Florida and Miller wedding -->
          <!-- Fiery got burned -->
          <!-- Tim works for Siemens full time -->
          <!-- Finished Hobbit -->
          <!-- Started Windwaker -->

          <p>Tim, who was originally working for <a href="http://www.turnberrysolutions.com/">Turnberry Solutions</a> since the beginning of the year (please see the amazing story in <a href="2010-testimony.pdf">last year's testimony (PDF)</a> for how God set that up!), had been consulting at <a href="http://www.medical.siemens.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay~q_catalogId~e_-1~a_catTree~e_100010,1008631,1025982,1025975,1025985~a_langId~e_-1~a_productId~e_190987~a_storeId~e_10001.htm">Siemens</a>. In April he left Turnberry and was hired by Siemens full time.</p>
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561004033/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/tim-fiery-whale.jpg" alt="Pic of Tim and Fiery on killer whales" width="200px" height="133px" class="right" /></a>
          <p>We were feeling adventurous, so with a 2 and a half year old, a one year old, and a baby 20 weeks old in utero, we took a trip to Florida for the Miller's wedding where Tim would lead a few songs in worship. Pop-pop (Tim's dad) came with us and it was a lot of fun. We had a chance to go to <a href="http://www.seaworld.com/">Sea World</a> for two days and make a quick visit to the <a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/magic-kingdom/">Magic Kingdom</a> to visit Victoria, one of Tim's cousins. The kids <strong>loved</strong> Sea World, with the exception of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyBwQsvP8GU">Shamu</a>, who splashed Fiery. Fiery <strong>did not</strong> like it (that's putting it mildly). In Florida we finished reading The Hobbit and talked about what our next book would be.</p>
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561004933/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/pop-pop-honor.jpg" alt="Pic of Pop pop and Honor at wedding " width="133px" height="200px" class="left" /></a>
          <p>When we came home Tim took up <a href="http://zelda.com/gcn/">Wind Waker (Zelda)</a> for the GameCube and the kids (especially Fiery) would be very excited that Abba (what we call Tim) would be playing with “the little man who runs around.”</p>
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561007287/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/fiery-blankets.jpg" alt="Pic of Fiery in blankets 04-18-2011" width="200px" height="133px" class="right" /></a>
          <p>At the end of this month Fiery gave us her first real scare when she poured a boiling cup of tea on herself. We quickly immersed her in cold water but the burn did take a couple of weeks to heal. In the beginning Fiery confined herself to the couch and couldn't go anywhere without a blanket, but after a few days she began to eat regularly again and run around. It's been very encouraging asking her about it and hearing her thoughts: “Remember, Fiery, when you got burned?” and she replies, “Yes. And then God healed me!”</p>

          <p>In May we got some new toys: an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad 2</a> and a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">Macbook Pro</a> to replace Tim's ailing Macbook (It served him well, for over 5 years!). We decided to start reading through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter">Harry Potter</a> books and watching the corresponding movie after each book. The goal was to finish all seven in time for the last movie to come out in theaters. We became vigorous Harry Potter readers, reading about 100 pages a week and finally succumbing to getting the audio book so we could “read” in the car. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger">Hermione</a> will never sound the same. Thanks a lot, <a href="http://www.jim-dale.com/">Jim</a>.</p>

          <p>For some reason Tim enjoys throwing his children and Honor got one for the history books at a party for our friends' son, Jakeob. Thankfully, Nik and Alicia didn't stop us due to the insurance hazard and Jesse played along like a champ. Honor looked terrified but came out alive and healthy.</p>
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561015589/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/visher-van.jpg" alt="Pic of every one in van 05-28-2011 " width="200px" height="133px" class="right" /></a>
          <p>The siren call of the wild drew us out again, and this time we think we were over our heads; an even more pregnant Jess, a 14 month old, and a 30 month old, drove for <strong>12 straight hours</strong> to Chicago to visit some relatives in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Sprinter#Dodge_Branded_North_American_sales">Sprinter</a> with Tim's family (including baby Noah, 3 months old). It was a fun time but who knew that <strong>both</strong> toddlers would get sick (with fevers) over that weekend? We learned our limits and enjoyed the time with family.</p>

          <h3 class="narrative-break">June</h3>
          <!-- Fruit picking- strawberries -->
          <!-- New pastor in church -->
          <!-- Harper House purchase -->

          <p>In June our <a href="http://hawsavenueumc.org/">church</a> received a new pastor who we like a lot, <a href="http://hawsavenueumc.org/staff/#pastor">Pastor Joyce Anderson</a>. She has a very different style than our previous Pastor, and she's working her tail off for the church.</p>
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561016217/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/fiery-strawberries.jpg" alt="Pic of Fiery eating strawberry 06-16-2011" width="200px" height="133px" class="left" /></a>
          <p>The Harper Clan purchased their first home base and we've had lots of fun play dates and meals in it since.</p>
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561018841/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/fiery-strawberries-mixer.jpg" alt="Pic of Fiery eating strawberries from mixer" width="133px" height="200px" class="right" /></a>
          <p>We started fruit picking to make jams for the first time. This month was strawberries so Jess, the kids, Katie and Noah, went to a farm out in Quakertown and got about 6 pounds of strawberries and we just finished our last jar. </p>

          <h3 class="narrative-break">July</h3>
          <!-- Beach trip and towing experience -->
          <!-- Fruit picking- blueberries -->
          <!-- Tim starts VIMgolf -->
          <!-- Cut Jess's dreads shorter -->
          <!-- Christina and Redmond -->

          <p>In July Tim started a video series called <a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/222837">VimGolf in Emacs</a> and puts out a new video every week. We are enjoying his <strike>complete and utter nerdery</strike> minor Internet stardom.</p>
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561034201/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/honor-sand.jpg" alt="Pic of Honor and sand 07-09-2011" width="200px" height="133px" class="left" /></a>
          <p>Honor took his first trip to <a href="http://www.seaislebeach.com/">the beach</a> where he got a mouthful of sand. Fiery, who was so excited about the ocean, fell in the ocean water after 1 minute, and didn't want another part of it for the rest of the trip. We had dinner with our Aunt Lynn's family at their beach trailer in Sea Isle.</p>
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561033159/in/set-72157628542202391/"><img src="img/fiery-fall-water.jpg" alt="Fiery's fall into the water 07-09-2011" width="200px" height="133px" class="right" /></a>
          <p>On the way home, at about 10 ㏘, we got a flat, with no key to take the tire off. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561034679/in/set-72157628542202391/"><img src="img/kids-towing.jpg" alt="Pic of parking lot with kids on towing experience, if it'll fit" width="200px" height="133px" class="left inline" /></a>
            After three hundred and seventy-five dollars, a new <a href="http://midatlantic.aaa.com/?zip=19401&devicecd=PC">AAA</a> membership, and 7 hours we all got home at about 5 ㏂. On the bright side the kids <strong>loved</strong> riding in the big tow truck all the way home.</p>
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561023445/in/set-72157628542202391/"><img src="img/mom-mom-kids-blueberries.jpg" alt="Pic of mom mom with kids in blueberries " width="200px" height="133px" class="right" /></a>
          <p>We went Blueberry picking with Mom-mom and Grand-pop (Jess's parents) in West Chester and froze the blueberries and the kid's enjoyed blueberry pancakes for weeks afterwards.</p>
          <p>Christina, Tim's younger sister, started dating a bloke named Redmond who she met in Eastern University and he would be a wonderful acquisition for our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hQgCJGNspI">evil empire</a>.</p>


          <h3 class="narrative-break">August</h3>
          <!-- Finished Harry Potter -->
          <!-- Cleaning system -->
          <!-- Cook day -->

          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561035193/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/belly.jpg" alt="Picture of belly" width="133px" height="200px" class="left" /></a>
          <p>Not much happened in August. Jess, who thought she would have a baby in August, made sure to tie Tim to the ship's mast and stuff the rest of our ears with wax. She developed a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Large-Family-Logistics-Kim-Brenneman/dp/1934554499">cleaning system</a> for the house (which has worked wonderfully when she was able to implement it after the birth) and we started Cook Day. Cook day is on Sunday and we do all of our cooking for the week in the span of three to four hours before church. This has been a <strong>wonderful</strong> idea and we would highly recommend it to any family, no matter how big.</p>
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561024985/in/set-72157628542202391/"><img src="img/extra.jpg" alt="Extra picture here" width="200px" height="133px" class="right" /></a>
          <p>We finished Harry Potter in time to see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NYt1qirBWg">the movie</a>. Tim and Jess had their first night alone since Fiery was born <strong>(!)</strong> when Fiery and Honor slept over their Uncle Jesse and Aunt Katie's house.</p>

          <h3 class="narrative-break">September</h3>
          <!-- Tim gets a scooter -->
          <!-- Zeal born -->
          <!-- Started pursuing purchase of our apartment -->
          <!-- Traded our Scion for the mini van -->

          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561037563/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/zeal-measured.jpg" alt="Picture of Zeal being measured 09-02-2011" width="200px" height="133px" class="left" /></a>
          <p>In early September we introduced the newest member of the family: <a href="http://thevishers.info/zeal-manasseh-visher-birth/">Zeal Manasseh Visher</a>, who's timing could not have been more perfect (please see <a href="http://thevishers.info/zeal-manasseh-visher-birth/">his website</a> for more details). He has been extremely smiley and fairly easy tempered making this transition the easiest by far.</p>
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561039295/in/set-72157628542202391/"><img src="img/christina-zeal.jpg" alt="Picture of Christina and Zeal " width="200px" height="133px" class="right" /></a>
          <p>Now we had three kids, and a little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scion_xA">Scion xA</a>. That's not exactly a 5 person car, especially when 3 of those people need car seats, so Tim's dad generously let us trade his <a href="http://www.toyota.com/sienna/">mini-van</a> for our little Scion. We loved that car but it was time for a bigger one. Tim also fulfilled a life long dream and purchased a used scooter to travel to and from work in. Jess has been on it once.</p>
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561068443/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/scooter.jpg" alt="Picture of the scooter" width="200px" height="133px" class="left" /></a>
          <p>We prayed about it and felt led to begin to pursue purchasing our apartment from our landlords and good friends. We are still in the process and are excited about God's timing for it all.</p>

          <h3 class="narrative-break">October</h3>
          <!-- Got our own grill -->
          <!-- VFB in a blizzard -->
          <!-- Finished Windwaker -->
          <!-- Fiery sees first movie in theater -->
          <!-- Fiery's third birthday -->
          <!-- Greener Partners -->

          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561048379/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/fiery-plate.jpg" alt="Pic of Fiery and plate outside 10-06-2011 " width="133px" height="200px" class="right" /></a>
          <p>In October Fiery had her third birthday. We started a tradition that you get to pick what you want for dinner and who you want to share it with on your birthday. Fiery wanted macaroni and cheese and cookies in the backyard with Pop-pop. So that's what we did and, not surprisingly, she ate her dessert before her meal.</p>
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561055601/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/pop-pop-kids-vfb.jpg" alt="Picture of Pop pop and kids at VFB " width="200px" height="133px" class="left" /></a>
          <p>We had our first Visher Family Bash: a yearly party for our family and friends that we wanted to start sometime in the fall. And what a better way to start it off than an October blizzard? It was a ton of fun, very cold, and Tim purchased his own grill for the occasion. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rwsuXHA7RA">It was an unforgettable event.</a></p>
          <p>Tim finished Wind Waker on the GameCube (no more “little man who runs around”). Fiery had her first movie theater experience when Tim took her to see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sj1MT05lAA">The Lion King</a> in 3D. She refused to wear the glasses, but we think she enjoyed the experience even though we weren't exactly sure what she saw.</p>
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561050519/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/cousins.jpg" alt="Pic of the Cousins " width="200px" height="133px" class="right" /></a>
          <p>We attended a <a href="http://www.localharvest.org/hillside-farm-at-elwyn-M37715">Fall Festival in Media</a> at Hillside Farm, a wonderful farm right around the corner from us, sponsored by an organization we're very excited about called <a href="http://greenerpartners.org/">Greener Partners</a>. They are committed to educating the community in farming and growing a garden through classes (for young and old). <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561051453/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/imah-kids-ride.jpg" alt="Pic of me, Fiery and Honor on ride 10-22-2011" width="200px" height="133px" class="left inline" /></a> They have a local market 15 minutes from us with bonfires, kids activities, and community events. We also signed up for our first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Supported_Agriculture">CSA</a> for 2012 through their farm in Media. We are very excited about that and will let you know how the produce was! </p>

          <h3 class="narrative-break">November</h3>
          <!-- First Visher/Harper Thanksgiving -->
          <!-- Trip to Tyler Arboretum -->
          <!-- Sponsored first child -->
          <!-- Did our first OCC -->

          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561056581/in/set-72157628542202391/"><img src="img/kids-treehouse.jpg" alt="Pic of kids pointing at tree house sign 22-05-2011" width="200px" height="133px" class="right" /></a>
          <p>In November we visited the <a href="http://www.tylerarboretum.org/">Tyler Arboretum</a> for the first time to see their <a href="http://www.tylerarboretum.org/treehouse-exhibit.asp">Tree House</a> exhibit with Pop-pop.</p>
          <p>We sponsored our first child through <a href="http://www.compassion.com/">Compassion</a>. We thought it would be a wonderful thing if each of our kids could have a friend in another country who we would help monetarily with their basic needs. We felt led to choose Shelya for Fiery, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561071211/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/fiery-sheyla.jpg" alt="Pic of Fiery holding Sheyla's photo 12-03-2011" width="200px" height="133px" class="left inline" /></a> a little girl just a little over Fiery's age who lives in Bolivia, the poorest country in South America. We want to encourage Fiery to pray for this little girl as well as write to her when she is able to.</p>
          <p>We also did our first <a href="http://www.samaritanspurse.org/index.php/OCC/">Operation Christmas Child</a> shoe box. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561060907/in/set-72157628542202391"><img src="img/fiery-shoebox.jpg" alt="Pic of Fiery in mini van with shoebox " width="200px" height="133px" class="right inline" /></a> As each of our children turns two, we will fill a shoe box full of toys, treats and hygienic necessities, to be shipped to a boy or girl in a famished country. This year Fiery filled her shoe box for a little girl 2-4 years old. This is something we've been meaning to do for years, and are excited that we finally did.</p>
          <p>This seems to be the year of starting traditions because for Thanksgiving we started a new Visher/Harper tradition where the day after Thanksgiving, we all got together, had a non-traditional Thanksgiving dinner and did one big sleep over. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561065503/in/set-72157628542202391/"><img src="img/fiery-excited.jpg" alt="Pic of Fiery being SO excited for the train 11-26-2011" width="200px" height="133px" class="left inline" /></a> The next day we took a trip on a train (Honor, Noah and Zeal's first train ride!) to the <a href="http://www.readingterminalmarket.org/">Reading Terminal Market</a> and enjoyed good food and super nice weather. As sad as it is that we'll probably never be able to order <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steak_tartare">The Travis</a> from Roger at <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2011/05/03/harry-ochs-out-at-reading-terminal.html">Harry Ochs</a> again, it was still so much fun and we look forward to doing it again next year!</p>

          <p>After a couple different hair styles, Jess decided to buzz her hair and will probably spend the next five or six years growing it out again. </p>


          <h3 class="narrative-break">December</h3>
          <!-- Updated Christmas letter -->
          <!-- First Christmas tree -->
          <!-- Fiery learns her ABCs (capital letters) -->
          <!-- Tim starts a new Bible plan -->
          <!-- Christmas photo -->

          <p>In December we updated our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pVMUxZballJVltq5OZ3ztuSt2EevvjDybhauDJ623n0/edit">gift letter</a> (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G48yryO7AEQxVCfm0toXSOku3Wf2du90JKnnilMxHbs/edit">the original</a>) and Tim <strike>started</strike> <strike>stopped</strike> <strike>started again</strike> <strike>wanted really badly to do it well but can't quite seem to do it</strike> worked on a new <a href="http://www.esv.org/assets/pdfs/rp.one.year.tract.pdf">Bible reading plan (PDF)</a>. We bought our first full size Christmas tree and managed to fit it into our living room. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561075317/in/set-72157628542202391/"><img src="img/christmas.jpg" alt=" A Christmas photo pic" width="200px" height="133px" class="left inline" /></a> The kids love it and were happy to decorate. We started going through an ebook called <a href="http://truthinthetinsel.com/">Truth in Tinsel</a> which has activities for young children to make your own ornaments that tell the story of the birth of Christ. We've been doing about half of them but it's encouraging that Fiery is excited to make them.</p>
          <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stopsineman/6561076333/in/set-72157628542202391/"><img src="img/zeal-thrown.jpg" alt="Pic of Tim throwing Zeal to Jess" width="200px" height="133px" class="right" /></a>
          <p>We took our super cool Christmas photo with no injuries and put together a website that you are now reading.</p>
          <p>We just found out that we've been tentatively approved for mortgage assistance from MontCo, which means we're one step closer to becoming owners of 114 Haws!</p>
          <p>Finally, Tim rediscovered that riding <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=114+Haws+Avenue,+West+Norriton,+PA&daddr=40.0871363,-75.4487598+to:40.079802,-75.443277+to:40.0765437,-75.4521059+to:51+valley+stream+pkwy+malvern+pa&hl=en&ll=40.088841,-75.436249&spn=0.112811,0.178871&sll=40.076397,-75.446377&sspn=0.028208,0.044718&geocode=FVQkZAIdIyyC-ylbKv_5EJbGiTFl3l9jS72JWg%3BFWCuYwIdSb6A-ykXHBRjkJPGiTGNsrVkPkx9rw%3BFbqRYwIds9OA-ynPInWkg5PGiTH9m13aRKfVfA%3BFf-EYwIdN7GA-yk1n1kBdpPGiTGdpNM_v7K5EQ%3BFUpCYwIdi59_-ykpHvChppLGiTFqW9CzV_uCNg&vpsrc=6&dirflg=b&mra=dpe&mrsp=3&sz=15&via=1,2,3&t=h&z=13&lci=bike">13-miles</a> on a bike (read: bicycle) into work isn't that big a deal.</p>
